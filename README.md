# Ping-Pong-Game
This Ping Pong game is a straightforward Java implementation using the Swing library for graphical user interface components. The game comprises two paddles controlled by players through keyboard input and a ball that bounces between these paddles. The primary goal is to prevent the ball from reaching the screen edges while simultaneously attempting to maneuver the ball past the opponent's paddle.

Key technologies include Java, Swing, and multi-threading. Java serves as the main programming language, while Swing provides essential GUI components such as JPanel, JFrame, and graphics utilities for rendering game elements. The game runs on a separate thread to ensure smooth animation and continuous gameplay, implementing the Runnable interface for the game loop.

Player control is facilitated through the KeyListener interface, capturing keyboard input for paddle movements. The game window is fixed at a size of 1000x555 pixels, establishing a standard playing area. A ball, represented by the Ball class, moves dynamically, bouncing off paddles and the top/bottom edges of the window. Players score points when the ball successfully passes the opponent's paddle, triggering a reset with new paddles and a new ball.

The score is visibly displayed on the screen, offering feedback on the game's progress. The implementation ensures smooth animation, realistic paddle and ball movement, and collision detection for an engaging gaming experience. The provided code features a game loop that handles continuous updates, collision checks, and rendering to maintain a consistent frame rate.

While the provided code lacks a main method, it serves as a foundational structure for a Ping Pong game and would require further development to incorporate additional features and serve as the game's entry point


Technologies Used:

Java: The primary programming language used for game development.
Swing: A Java GUI toolkit used for creating the graphical user interface. It provides components like JPanel, JFrame, and graphics utilities for rendering game elements.
Thread: The game runs on a separate thread to ensure smooth animation and continuous gameplay. The Runnable interface is implemented to handle the game loop.
KeyEvent: The game captures keyboard input through the KeyListener interface, allowing players to control the paddles.
Random: The Random class is used for generating random values, although its usage is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code.
Graphics: The Graphics class is utilized for drawing various game elements, including paddles, the ball, and the score.
Dimension: The Dimension class is used to define the size of the game window.
Game Description:

The game window has a fixed size of 1000x555 pixels, providing a standard playing area.
Two paddles, paddle1 and paddle2, are controlled by players using keyboard input.
The ball, represented by the Ball class, moves around the screen, bouncing off the paddles and the top/bottom edges of the window.
Players gain points when the ball passes the opponent's paddle, and the game resets with new paddles and a new ball.
The score is displayed on the screen.
The game features continuous animation, smooth movement, and collision detection to ensure a realistic gaming experience.
The code uses a game loop to handle updates, collision checks, and rendering, ensuring a constant frame rate.
Note: The provided code does not include a main method, and it would need further development to include the game's entry point and additional functionalities.
