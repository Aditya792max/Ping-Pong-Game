This is a simple implementation of a Ping Pong game using Java and the Swing library for graphical user interface components. The game features two paddles, controlled by the players using keyboard input, and a ball that bounces between the paddles. The objective is to prevent the ball from reaching the edge of the screen while trying to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

Technologies Used:

Java: The primary programming language used for game development.
Swing: A Java GUI toolkit used for creating the graphical user interface. It provides components like JPanel, JFrame, and graphics utilities for rendering game elements.
Thread: The game runs on a separate thread to ensure smooth animation and continuous gameplay. The Runnable interface is implemented to handle the game loop.
KeyEvent: The game captures keyboard input through the KeyListener interface, allowing players to control the paddles.
Random: The Random class is used for generating random values, although its usage is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code.
Graphics: The Graphics class is utilized for drawing various game elements, including paddles, the ball, and the score.
Dimension: The Dimension class is used to define the size of the game window.
Game Description:

The game window has a fixed size of 1000x555 pixels, providing a standard playing area.
Two paddles, paddle1 and paddle2, are controlled by players using keyboard input.
The ball, represented by the Ball class, moves around the screen, bouncing off the paddles and the top/bottom edges of the window.
Players gain points when the ball passes the opponent's paddle, and the game resets with new paddles and a new ball.
The score is displayed on the screen.
The game features continuous animation, smooth movement, and collision detection to ensure a realistic gaming experience.
The code uses a game loop to handle updates, collision checks, and rendering, ensuring a constant frame rate.
Note: The provided code does not include a main method, and it would need further development to include the game's entry point and additional functionalities.
